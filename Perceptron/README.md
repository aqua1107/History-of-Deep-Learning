In machine learning, the perceptron is an algorithm for supervised learning of binary classifiers.<br>
It was invented by American psychologist Frank Rosenblatt around 1957.<br>
However, the perceptron could only perform binary classification under linear conditions.<br>
Therefore, problems like XOR remained unsolved for about 30 years,<br> 
until the first neural network with hidden layers, along with the backpropagation algorithm, emerged in 1986.
