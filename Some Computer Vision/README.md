This is my first attempt at disassembling a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a fundamental type of artificial neural network widely used in the field of Computer Vision.<br>
CNNs were first popularized in the 1990s by Yann LeCun’s LeNet architecture, which was used for handwritten digit recognition.<br>
They gained widespread attention after AlexNet’s breakthrough performance in the 2012 ImageNet competition, marking the beginning of the deep learning era in computer vision.<br>
Since then, CNNs have evolved through architectures like VGG, GoogLeNet, ResNet, and EfficientNet, and continue to play a central role in modern vision systems.
