# Minimal RNN Implementation in NumPy

This repository contains a from-scratch implementation of a simple Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) using only NumPy. It includes:

- Forward pass over a sequence
- Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)
- Weight update using gradient descent

### Features
- No PyTorch or TensorFlow
- Educational purpose
- Easy to read and extend (e.g. LSTM, GRU)
